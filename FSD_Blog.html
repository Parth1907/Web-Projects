            <p>What is full stack development? Full stack development is the knowledge of front and back end languages alongwith database systems. It can also include frameworks. The front end includes the visual and the interactive part (often known as the client side). The back end includes the server-side part and the database system manages all the data generated by the user. The frameworks are some pieces of built code that can be utilized by a developer to make a site run more efficiently. It can be made out of either front-end languages or back-end languages, or both.</p>

            <p>The front-end languages mainly include three languages. These are 
                <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The back-end languages can include many languages like -
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                </ul> 
            The Database system used can also be chosen from a wide array of choices like 
            SQL lite, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, etc.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>The first step in full-stack development can be considered <em>HTML</em>. The full form of HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to structure a website and define where and how to place all the contents in it, like the text, images, tables, etc.<br> 
            Then comes <em>CSS</em>, whose full form is Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to style a website and place all the designs and stylisation in a single file. It can also be used in an HTML file itself. <br>
            Lastly comes <em>JavaScript</em>. JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that is used to make a web page interactive. It is only when JavaScript is used that a website goes from static to dynamic. Some examples of what JavaScript does is that it can change the colour of a button when the cursor comes over it, scrolling a website, zooming in and many other things. Other than this JavaScript can also be used on the server-side, in mobile applications, and also in some video games.</p>

            <p>In the back-end site of a website, many languages can be chosen.
                <ul> 
                    <li><em>Python</em> is a programming language that is easy to learn and used mainly to integrate systems quickly on a site. It is used for many things due to its vast libraries. </li>
                    <li><em>Java</em> is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages that is highly scalable. It can used to make web applications and make a website run efficiently. </li>
                    <li><em>C++</em> is a general-purpose language that is highly used for competitive programming and can also be used as a back-end language. </li>
                    <li><em>PHP</em> is an open-source, server-side scripting language that is specifically designed for web development. It is known as a server-side scripting language as its code is executed on the server side. The full form of PHP is Hypertext preprocessor. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Lastly, we come to databases. They are a collection of interrelated data which is used to efficiently insert, retrieve and delete some data. This data can be represented in the form of tables, graphs, reports, etc. Some common databases are Oracle, MongoDB, and SQL.<br> 
            <em>Oracle</em> database is a collection of data that is treated as a unit. The purpose of this database is to store and retrieve information related to the query. It is a database server and is used to manage information. <br>
            <em>MongoDB</em> is a popular NoSQL database, and is an open source document-oriented database. The term NoSQL means non-relational. It means that MongoDB isnt based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for the storage and retrieval of data.<br> 
            <em>SQL</em>, Structured Query Language, is a standard Database language that is used to create, maintain and retrieve the relational database.</p>
